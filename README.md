# mcstatue-php
Source code for an updated Minecraft player statue generator written in php (works with MC 1.10+)

## *Disclaimer!*
##This project is unfinished, and requires updates. The only feature missing is the cutting of the duplicated skin files. All else works, including verification, duplicating of skin, uploading of skins, changing the players skin, pulling the skull data, and generating the command.
